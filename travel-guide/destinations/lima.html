            <h1>About</h1>
            <div><h4><b>Ireland</b> is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in Northwestern Europe. Geopolitically, the island is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland 
              – a sovereign state covering five-sixths of the island) and Northern Ireland (part of the United Kingdom – covering the remaining sixth). 
              It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, 
              the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world. As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, with 5.1 million in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, 
              ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.</h4></div>

    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <hr class="story-underline">
    <p>
      Ireland's culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples,
      later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly Gaelic culture,
      Anglicisation, Americanisation and aspects of broader European culture).
      In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic nations of
      Europe, alongside Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Isle of Man and Brittany.
      This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate
      designs termed Irish interlace or Celtic knotwork. These can be seen in
      the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is
      still popular today in jewellery and graphic art, as is the distinctive
      style of traditional Irish music and dance, and has become indicative of
      modern "Celtic" culture in general.
