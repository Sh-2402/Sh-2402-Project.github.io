                  The archipelago was discovered in 1503, then becoming Brazil's first Donatary Captaincy. After it was abandoned by its donatary, the island suffered many attacks from pirates, having been occupied by the Dutch from 1629 to 1654 and by the French from 1736 to 1737.
                  In 1737, Portugal took back control of the island, which was then turned into a Penal Colony (prison) for common prisioners from Pernambuco and later on for political prisioners as well. <br><br>
                  It was not until 1988 when Fernando de Noronha was incorporated back into the state of Pernambuco and Fernando de Noronha's National Marine Park was created, which contributed to the island becoming a famous touristic destination.

                <hr class="story-underline">
                <p>
                  The beaches in Fernando de Noronha are a must! They are divided in two: Inner Sea(calmer sea) and Outer Sea (rougher sea). The island's coast is lined with hypnotizing, scenic tropical beaches, where some are good for relaxing and enjoying a cold drink while others are better for surfing or swimming.
                  Fernando de Noronha has 14 beaches, but our top recommendations would be: <b>Conceição Beach (Praia da Conceição)</b>, <b>Dog Beach (Paia do Cachorro)</b>, <b>Sancho Bay (Baía do Sancho)</b>, with the latter having been voted as 'best beach in the world' for six years by TripAdvisor's Travellers Choice.

                <h3>Go Scuba Diving</h3>
                <hr class="story-underline">
                <p>
                 One of the most exciting activities to do in Fernando de Noronha is, without a doubt, to go scuba diving/snorkeling. The island's thriving marine life, warm and crystal clear water make of Noronha one of the top
                 destinations for scuba diving, not only in Brazil but in the whole South American continent! Have in mind that depending on the time of the year, some beaches will be better for scuba diving/snorkeling than others, for example:
                 In january and february, <b>Sueste Beach (Praia do Sueste)</b> is a good pick, whereas for September and October we would recommend <b>Sancho Bay (Baía do Sancho)</b> and <b>Dog Beach (Paia do Cachorro)</b>. You can expect
                 to find a diverse marine life in your adventures under water!

              <h3>Hike the Piquinho Trail</h3>
              <hr class="story-underline">
              <p>
                If you are into hiking then you can't miss hiking the Piquinho trail. Piquinho is a hill located just next to the highest point of the archipelago, Morro do Pico. 
                At the top you will be able to enjoy a nearly 360-degree view of the island. The hike takes about 20 minutes to reach the top, so it's not long but it can be slightly difficult,
                with steep and rocky parts that can be a bit of a pain. The trail is not properly marked, so be careful and if you feel necessary, think about hiring a guide. This is a great spot to watch
                the sunrise or sunset!
